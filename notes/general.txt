Upgrades and Enhancements for a Full-Fledged Personal Trainer Backend

1. User Profile & Metrics
   - Extend user model with age, gender, height, body fat percentage, fitness level.
   - Enable storage of biometric measurements (e.g., waist, hips, blood pressure).
   - Add endpoint to update/view profile and baseline metrics.

2. Workout & Progress Tracking
   - Add endpoints to log completed workouts (with actual duration, sets, reps, weights).
   - Store workout history; compute trends (volume, frequency, progression).
   - Provide an endpoint to retrieve progress summaries and graph-ready data (e.g., weight over time).

3. Nutrition Logging & Macro Tracking
   - Add endpoints for daily meal logs (calories, macros breakdown).
   - Integrate a food database or nutrition API to auto-calculate macros from user entries.
   - Generate weekly nutrition summaries and trend analytics.

4. Plan Scheduling & Reminders
   - Introduce scheduling: allow users to assign specific times to workouts and meals.
   - Integrate with a task scheduler (e.g., Celery + Redis) to send email/SMS/push notifications as reminders.
   - Extend notifications to include adaptive, motivational messages that keep users engaged (e.g., “Time for your workout!”, “Don’t forget to log your meal”).
   - Provide user-configurable preferences for notification channels, frequency, and quiet hours to tailor the experience.
   - Bundle or batch reminders intelligently to prevent notification fatigue, adjusting send-times based on user behavior, local time zones, or past interactions.
   - Add endpoints to snooze, cancel, or reschedule reminders.

5. AI Coach Chat & Feedback Loop
   - Implement a conversational chat endpoint so users can ask follow-up questions to the AI coach.
   - Store chat history and allow context-aware dialogue (e.g., modify plan based on user feedback).
   - Provide a feedback mechanism to rate AI suggestions and retrain or adjust recommendations.

6. Training Programs & Levels
   - Offer predefined training programs (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
   - Allow users to select or switch programs; adjust workout intensity automatically.
   - Add templates for strength training, hypertrophy, endurance, mobility.

7. Integrations & Third-Party Sync
   - Sync workout/nutrition logs with wearable APIs (Fitbit, Strava, Apple Health).
   - Provide webhooks or OAuth flows for external fitness apps.
   - Export data in CSV/JSON for users to backup or integrate elsewhere.

8. Advanced AI Capabilities
   - Replace placeholder estimator with a custom tool function or fine-tuned model.
   - Incorporate personalized adaptive plans: adjust plan dynamically based on user compliance.
   - Use AI to detect plateaus and suggest deload weeks, periodization cycles.

9. Community & Social Features
   - Add endpoints to follow friends, share achievements, or join challenges.
   - Implement group challenges or leaderboards.

10. Security, Performance & Testing
   - Enforce rate limiting on AI endpoints to manage API costs.
   - Secure sensitive endpoints with scopes/roles (e.g., admin, coach, user).
   - Add end-to-end tests for new features; improve test coverage for critical flows.
   - Document API changes in docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md and update OpenAPI schemas.

These enhancements will turn the current AI-powered planner into a comprehensive personal trainer backend,
providing richer data tracking, interactive coaching, scheduling, integrations, and community engagement.

--- Feature Assignment: Backend vs Frontend Responsibilities ---

For each proposed upgrade, this breakdown shows where (FastAPI backend vs iOS/Apple Watch frontend) the primary work belongs.

1. User Profile & Metrics
   Backend:
     - Extend user DB model (age, gender, height, body fat %, fitness level).
     - APIs to create, read, update profile and baseline metrics.
   Frontend (iOS + Watch):
     - Profile setup & edit screens with validation.
     - Display current metrics and history (charts, tables).

2. Workout & Progress Tracking
   Backend:
     - Endpoints to log completed workouts (duration, sets, reps, weights).
     - Persist workout history; compute trends (volume, frequency, progression).
     - Summary APIs for chart-ready progress data (e.g., weight over time).
   Frontend:
     - UI to record workouts on Watch/iPhone.
     - Progress graphs (weight, volume, consistency) in app.

3. Nutrition Logging & Macro Tracking
   Backend:
     - Daily meal-log endpoints; integrate nutrition database/API.
     - Compute macros and calories; weekly nutrition summaries.
   Frontend:
     - Meal entry UI (text, barcode scanner, favorites).
     - Display macro/calo breakdown and weekly nutrition dashboard.

4. Plan Scheduling & Reminders
   Backend:
     - Scheduler (e.g., Celery + Redis) to queue reminders.
     - APIs to manage (create, snooze, cancel) reminders.
     - Push notification integration (APNs, email/SMS webhook).
   Frontend:
     - Scheduling UI (date/time pickers) for workouts/meals.
     - Local notification handling on iOS/Watch.

5. AI Coach Chat & Feedback Loop
   Backend:
     - Chat endpoint; maintain conversation context server-side.
     - Persist chat transcripts and feedback ratings.
